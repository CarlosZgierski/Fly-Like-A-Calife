# Fly-Like-A-Calife
Small Unity Project done in a space of a week for a programming class project deadline. This project was completely programmed by me (Carlos Alberto Zgierski da Silveira)

The project was done in 2017 and was never completed, but i have future intentions on further developing it at sometime in the future.
This project has been done with no intention on selling. All the visual assets used on this project come from a free site, but since the project is now 2.5 years old, i can't unfortunely credit the original autor.
